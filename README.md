# Persian-Transliterator
A code transliterating the Persian script into the Roman Alphabet. Work in progress.

I would like the code to do this:


Input: هَر یه ساعَت یه قَطار به شَهر هَست.

Output: har ye sâ`at ye qatâr be šahr hast.


Right now it does this:


Input: هَر یه ساعَت یه قَطار به شَهر هَست

Output: har ih sâ'at ih qatâr be šahr hast.


Eventually I would love the code to transliterate Persian text without vowel markers like this:


Input: هر یه ساعت یه قطار به شهر هست

Output: har ye sâ`at ye qatâr be šahr hast.


Based on the following paper, it seems like building a neural net is the only way to go:

Currently, the code only does simple substitution, iterating over a list using a for loop.
It's faulty and complicated to make it work because of the many Persian reading rules and exceptions. Often a new substitution rule messes up a previous substitution rule.

How to use:

1) Clone the code to your computer.
2) Copy-paste the Persian text you want to transliterate into PersianText.txt and save.
3) Run code.
4) PersianText.txt will now contain the same text you copy pasted, transliterated using Roman letters.
